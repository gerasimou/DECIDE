UUV class
------------------
Outline the requirements of the application. The requirements are divided into two categories (system and local requirements), and the requirement its self is either a constraint or an objective.



UUVCapabilitySummary class
------------------
Stores and represents application specific contribution towards system level requirements



UUVCapabilitySummaryCollection class
------------------
Stores and represents peer received contributions alongside with the component individual contribution. Also contains the abstract findGlobalAllocation function, which includes the application specific partitioning algorithm, e.g. by allocating each part of the search and rescue area to a robot. 



UUVCLAReceipt class
------------------
A class that defines a dedicated thread for detecting changed in peer components. At the moment it contains an inner class TimeWindow that extends Thread class, a better way to do it is to implement Runnable interface (not so sure about it!).  



UUVConfiguration class
------------------
Represents and constitues properties that form component configuration (e.g. speed and sensor configuration in the UUV example). 



UUVMode class
------------------
All component configurations that share a configuration parameter are stored in a profile of execution(Mode). Also, the class provides the necessary functions to test if profile configurations meet the component local requirements.



UUVConfigurationsCollection class
------------------
Contains a collection that stores profile configurations. 



UUVEnvironment class
------------------
Stores environment parameters (e.g. sensor rate in the UUV example).



UUVLocalCapabilityAnalysis class
------------------
Produces a set of possible component contributions to system requirements



UUVLocalControl class
------------------
Ensures individual commitment to system requirements are met in the presence of changes and failures. Also, defines a dedicated thread for detecting changed in the managed component (e.g. MOOS component in the UUV case). 



UUVSelection class
------------------
Defines the logic for partitions system requirements.
